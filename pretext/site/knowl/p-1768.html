<p>Suppose, that, as in Example <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eg_error_C.html" title="Example 2.6.9">2.6.9</a>, we are attempting to determine the area of a triangle by measuring the lengths of two of its sides together with the angle between them and then using the formula</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
A(a,b,\theta) = \frac{1}{2} ab\sin\theta
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">Of course, in the real world <a class="fn-knowl" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-64-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.6.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a>, we cannot measure lengths and angles exactly. So if we need to know the area to within 1%,  the question becomes: “How accurately do we have to measure the side lengths and included angle if we want the area that we compute to have an error of no more than about 1%?”</p>
