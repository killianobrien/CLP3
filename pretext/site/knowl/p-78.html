<p>Just as we have done many times in the CLP texts, when we define a new type of object, we want to understand how it interacts with the basic operations of addition and multiplication. Vectors are no different, and we shall shortly see a natural way to define addition of vectors. Multiplication will be more subtle, and we shall start with multiplication of a vector by a number (rather than with multiplication of a vector by another vector).</p>
