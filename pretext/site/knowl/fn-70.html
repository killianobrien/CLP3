Although the authors of this text believe strongly in the supremacy of the modern metric system over the archaic chaos of imperial units, they are less certain of the appropriateness of revising well established colloquialisms. It is not at all clear that rewriting <em class="emphasis">I have a ton of work to do</em> as <em class="emphasis">I have a tonne of work to do</em> achieves very much except to give the impression that the author is wasting time adding two letters when they are expressing the sheer quantity of tasks that require their attention.
