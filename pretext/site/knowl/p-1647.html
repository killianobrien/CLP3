<p>Recreating this effect in computer generated graphics is called “hidden-surface elimination”.  In general, implementing hidden-surface elimination can be quite complicated. Often a technique called “ray tracing” is used<a class="fn-knowl" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-58-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.5.12"><sup> 12 </sup></a>. However, it is easy if you know about vectors and gradients, and you are only looking at a single convex body. By definition, a solid is convex if, whenever two points are in the solid, then the line segment joining the two points is also contained in the solid.</p>
