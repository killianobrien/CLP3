<p>In most computations involving rotational motion, the cross product shows up in one form or another. This is one of the main applications of the cross product. Consider, for example, a rigid body which is rotating at a constant rate of \(\Omega\) radians per second about an axis whose direction is given by the unit vector \(\hat\va\text{.}\) Let \(P\) be any point on the body. Let's figure out its velocity. Pick any point on the axis of rotation and designate it as the origin of our coordinate system. Denote by \(\vr\) the vector from the origin to the point \(P\text{.}\) Let \(\theta\) denote the angle between \(\hat\va\) and \(\vr\text{.}\) As time progresses the point \(P\) sweeps out a circle of radius \(R=|\vr\,|\sin\theta\text{.}\)</p>
