<p>Now we can build up the volume.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Concentrate on one approximate cube. Let's say that it contains the point with spherical coordinates \(\rho\text{,}\) \(\theta\text{,}\) \(\varphi\text{.}\) The cube has volume essentially \(\dee{V}
= \rho^2\sin\varphi\,\dee{\rho}\,\dee{\theta}\,\dee{\varphi}\text{,}\) by <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_dV_spherical.html" title="Equation 3.7.3">3.7.3</a>.</li>
<li>To get the volume any one searchlight, say the searchlight whose \(\varphi\) coordinate runs from \(\varphi\) to \(\varphi+\dee{\varphi}\text{,}\) we just add up the volumes of the approximate cubes in that searchlight, by integrating \(\rho\) from its smallest value on the searchlight, namely \(0\text{,}\) to its largest value on the searchlight, namely \(a\text{.}\) The volume of the searchlight is thus<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
\dee{\theta}\,\dee{\varphi}\int_0^a\dee{\rho}\  \rho^2\sin\varphi
\end{gather*}
</div>
</li>
<li>To get the volume of any one segment, say the segment whose \(\theta\) coordinate runs from \(\theta\) to \(\theta+\dee{\theta}\text{,}\) we just add up the volumes of the searchlights in that segment, by integrating \(\varphi\) from its smallest value on the segment, namely \(0\text{,}\) to its largest value on the segment, namely \(\beta\text{.}\) The volume of the segment is thus<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
\dee{\theta}\,\int_0^\beta \dee{\varphi}\ \sin\varphi
\int_0^a\dee{\rho}\  \rho^2
\end{gather*}
</div>
</li>
<li>To get the volume of \(\cV_1\text{,}\) the part of the ice cream cone in the first octant, we just add up the volumes of the segments that it contains, by integrating \(\theta\) from its smallest value in the octant, namely \(0\text{,}\) to its largest value on the octant, namely  \(\frac{\pi}{2}\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The volume in the first octant is thus<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\text{Volume}(\cV_1)
&amp;=\int_0^{\pi/2}\dee{\theta}\,\int_0^\beta \dee{\varphi}\ \sin\varphi
\int_0^a\dee{\rho}\  \rho^2\\
&amp;=\frac{a^3}{3}\int_0^{\pi/2}\dee{\theta}\,
\int_0^\beta \dee{\varphi}\ \sin\varphi\\
&amp;=\frac{a^3}{3}\big[1-\cos\be\big]\int_0^{\pi/2}\dee{\theta}\\
&amp;=\frac{\pi a^3}{6}\big[1-\cos\be\big]
\end{align*}
</div>
</li>
<li>So the volume of \(\cV\text{,}\) the total (four octant) ice cream cone, is<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\text{Volume}(\cV)=4\,\text{Volume}(\cV_1)
=\frac{4\pi a^3}{6}\big[1-\cos\be\big]
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">We can express \(\be\) (which was not given in the statement of the original problem) in terms of \(b\) (which was in the statement of the original problem), just by looking at the triangle</p>
