<p>Consider a skier who is sliding without friction on the hill \(y=h(x)\) in a two dimensional world. The skier is subject to two forces. One is gravity. The other acts perpendicularly to the hill. The second force automatically adjusts its magnitude so as to prevent the skier from burrowing into the hill. Suppose that the skier became airborne at some \((x_0,y_0)\) with \(y_0=h(x_0)\text{.}\) How fast was the skier going?</p></article><article class="exercise exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">35<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>

<p>(Three dimensional Pythagorean Theorem) A solid body in space with exactly four vertices is called a tetrahedron. Let \(A\text{,}\) \(B\text{,}\) \(C\) and \(D\) be the areas of the four faces of a tetrahedron. Suppose that the three edges meeting at the vertex opposite the face of area \(D\) are perpendicular to each other. Show that \(D^2=A^2+B^2+C^2\text{.}\)</p>

<p>(Three dimensional law of cosines)  Let \(A\text{,}\) \(B\text{,}\) \(C\) and \(D\) be the areas of the four faces of a tetrahedron. Let \(\al\) be the angle between the faces with areas \(B\) and \(C\text{,}\) \(\be\) be the angle between the faces with areas \(A\) and \(C\) and \(\ga\) be the angle between the faces with areas \(A\) and \(B\text{.}\) (By definition, the angle between two faces is the angle between the normal vectors to the faces.) Show that</p>
