<p>Next suppose that we are walking in the \(xy\)-plane and that the temperature at \((x,y)\) is \(f(x,y)\text{.}\) We can pass through the point \((x,y)=(a,b)\) moving in many different directions, and we cannot expect the measured rate of change of temperature if we walk parallel to the \(x\)-axis, in the direction of increasing \(x\text{,}\) to be the same as the measured rate of change of temperature if we walk parallel to the \(y\)-axis in the direction of increasing \(y\text{.}\) We'll start by considering just those two directions. We'll consider other directions (like walking parallel to the line \(y=x\)) later.</p>
