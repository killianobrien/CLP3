<p>Often the reason you are interested in a surface in 3d is that it is the graph \(z=f(x,y)\) of a function of two variables \(f(x,y)\text{.}\) Another good way to visualize the behaviour of a function \(f(x,y)\) is to sketch what are called its level curves. By definition, a level curve of \(f(x,y)\) is a curve whose equation is \(f(x,y)=C\text{,}\) for some constant \(C\text{.}\) It is the set of points in the \(xy\)-plane where \(f\) takes the value \(C\text{.}\) Because it is a curve in 2d, it is usually easier to sketch than the graph of \(f\text{.}\) Here are a couple of examples.</p>
