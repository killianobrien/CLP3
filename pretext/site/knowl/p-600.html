<p>If we drop a perpendicular from \(Q\) to the line \(L\text{,}\) it hits the line \(L\) at the point \(N\text{,}\) which is the point on \(L\) that is nearest \(Q\text{.}\) So the distance from \(Q\) to \(L\) is exactly the distance from \(Q\) to \(N\text{,}\) which is exactly the length of the vector from \(Q\) to \(N\text{.}\) In the figure above, \(\vw\) is the vector from \(Q\) to \(N\text{.}\) Now the vector \(\vw\) has to be perpendicular to the direction vector for \(L\text{.}\) That is,  \(\vw\) has to be perpendicular to \(\vd=\llt 1,1,2\rgt\text{.}\) However, as we saw in Warning <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/warn_line_normal.html" title="Warning 1.5.3: A line in three dimensions has infinitely many normal vectors">1.5.3</a>, there are a huge number of vectors in different directions that are perpendicular to \(\vd\text{.}\) So you might think that it is very hard to even determine the direction of \(\vw\text{.}\)</p>
