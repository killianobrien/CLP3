<p>Model a pendulum by a mass \(m\) that is connected to a hinge by an idealized rod that is massless and of fixed length \(\ell\text{.}\) Denote by \(\theta\) the angle between the rod and vertical. The forces acting on the mass are</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>gravity, which has magnitude \(mg\) and direction \(\llt 0,-1\rgt\text{,}\)</li>
<li>tension in the rod, whose magnitude \(\tau(t)\) automatically adjusts itself so that the distance between the mass and the hinge is fixed at \(\ell\) (so that the rod does not stretch or contract) and whose direction is always parallel to the rod,</li>
<li>and possibly some frictional forces, like friction in the hinge and air resistance. Assume that the total frictional force has magnitude proportional<a class="fn-knowl" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-10-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.2.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a> to the speed of the mass and has direction opposite to the direction of motion of the mass. We'll call the constant of proportionality \(\beta\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
