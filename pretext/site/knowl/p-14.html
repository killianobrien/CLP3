<p>We do so in two steps. In the first step, we sketch the curves \(x^2-6x +y^2-4y=-12\text{,}\) \(x^2-6x +y^2-4y=-9\text{,}\) and \(y=1\text{.}\)</p>

<li>By completing squares, we see that the equation  \(x^2-6x +y^2-4y=-12\) is equivalent to \((x-3)^2 +(y-2)^2 =1\text{,}\) which is the circle of radius \(1\) centred on \((3,2)\text{.}\) It is sketched in the figure below.</li>
<li>By completing squares, we see that the equation  \(x^2-6x +y^2-4y=-9\) is equivalent to \((x-3)^2 +(y-2)^2 =4\text{,}\) which is the circle of radius \(2\) centred on \((3,2)\text{.}\) It is sketched in the figure below.</li>
<li>The point \((x,y)\) obeys \(y=1\) if and only if it is a distance \(1\) vertically above the \(x\)-axis. So \(y=1\) is the line that is parallel to the \(x\)-axis and is one unit above it. This line is also  sketched in the figure below.</li>
