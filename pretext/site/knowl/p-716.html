<p>The curve \(x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=a^{2/3}\) is called an astroid. From its equation, we would expect its sketch to look like a deformed circle. But it is probably not so obvious that it would have the pointy bits of the right hand figure. We will not explain here why they arise. The astroid is studied in some detail in Example 1.1.7 of the CLP-4 text. In particular, the above sketch is carefully developed there.</p>
