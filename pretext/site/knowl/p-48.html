<p>Sometimes attention is only focused on the behaviour of a function \(f\) over half its range, i.e. looking at \(f(x)\) for \(x \in (0 , \pi)\text{.}\) Before finding the Fourier series we can alter the definition of \(f\) over the other half, \((-\pi,0)\text{,}\) of its domain, in order to make \(f\) even or odd as we wish. In this way we can arrange that the resulting Fourier series is either a cosine series (one which consists of a constant term and cosine functions only) or a sine series (one which consists of sine functions only).</p>
