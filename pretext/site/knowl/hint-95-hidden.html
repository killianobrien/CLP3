<p>The notation in the statement of this question is horrendous â€” the symbol \(z\) is used with two different meanings in one equation. On the left hand side, it is a function of \(x\) and \(y\text{,}\) and on the right hand side, it is a function of \(s\) and \(t\text{.}\) Unfortunately that abuse of notation is also very common. Until you get used to it, undo this notation conflict by renaming the function of \(s\) and \(t\) to \(F(s,t)\text{.}\) That is, \(F(s,t) = f\big(2s+t\,,\,s-t\big)
\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Then, evaluate each term on the right-hand side of the equation.</p>
