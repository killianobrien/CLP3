<p>The Laplace transform method can also be applied to pairs of ODEs, both involving two unknown functions, \(x\) and \(y\) say, to which a simultaneous solution \((x,y)\) is sought. Or indeed, we could apply it to a set of \(n\) ODEs featuring \(n\) unknown functions \(x_1, \dots , x_n\text{,}\) although the details would soon become unwieldy (by hand at least) as \(n\) increases. We follow the four steps given previously, only in step 3 we will require strategies like substitution and elimination to find expressions for \(\bar{x}\) and \(\bar{y}\) as functions of \(s\) so that inverse transforms can be taken and the solution recovered.</p>
