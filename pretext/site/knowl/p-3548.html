<p>To re-express the given integral with the outside integral being with respect to \(z\text{,}\) we have to slice up \(V\) into horizontal plates by inserting planes of constant \(z\text{.}\) So we have to figure out what the part of \(V\) that lies in the horizontal plane \(z=Z\) looks like. From the figure above, we see that, in \(V\text{,}\) the smallest value of \(z\) is \(0\) and the biggest value of \(z\) is \(2\text{.}\) So \(Z\) is any constant between \(0\) and \(2\text{.}\) Again looking at the definition of \(V\) in \((*)\) above, we see that the point \((x,y,Z)\) lies in \(V\) if and only if</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
y\ge 0\qquad y\le 2\qquad
y\le 2-Z\qquad
x\ge 0\qquad
2x+y\le 2
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">Here, on the top, is a (2d) sketch showing the top view of all \((x,y)\)'s that obey those inequalities, and, on the bottom, is a (3d) sketch of all \((x,y,Z)\)'s that obey those inequalities.</p>
