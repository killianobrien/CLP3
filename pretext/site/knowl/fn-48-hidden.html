<body><div class="fn">The method for solving cubics was developed in the 15th century by del Ferro, Cardano and Ferrari (Cardano's student). Ferrari then went on to discover a formula for the roots of a quartic. Both the cubic and quartic formulae are extremely cumbersome, and no such formula exists for polynomials of degree 5 and higher. This is the famous Abel-Ruffini theorem.</div></body>
