<p>You are standing at a lone palm tree in the middle of the Exponential Desert. The height of the sand dunes around you is given in meters by</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h(x,y)=100 e^{-(x^2+2y^2)}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where \(x\) represents the number of meters east of the palm tree (west if \(x\) is negative) and \(y\) represents the number of meters north of the palm tree (south if \(y\) is negative).</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Suppose that you walk \(3\) meters east and 2 meters north. At your new location, \((3,2)\text{,}\) in what direction is the sand dune sloping most steeply downward?</li>
<li>If you walk north from the location described in part (a), what is the instantaneous rate of change of height of the sand dune?</li>
<li>If you are standing at \((3,2)\) in what direction should you walk to ensure that you remain at the same height?</li>
<li>Find the equation of the curve through \((3,2)\) that you should move along in order that you are always pointing in a steepest descent direction at each point of this curve.</li>
