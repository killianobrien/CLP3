<p>Many phenomena are modelled by equations that relate the rates of change of various quantities. As rates of change are given by derivatives, the resulting equations contain derivatives and so are called differential equations. We saw a number of such differential equations in §2.4 of the CLP-2 text.  In particular, a partial differential equation is an equation for an unknown function of two or more variables that involves the partial derivatives of the unknown function. The standard acronym for partial differential equation is PDE. PDEs<a class="fn-knowl" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-68-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.8.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> play a central role in modelling a huge number of different phenomena. Here is a table giving a bunch of named PDEs and what they are used for. It is far from complete.</p>
