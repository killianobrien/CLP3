<ul class="disc">
<li>The equations \(x^2+y^2=a^2\) and \(x^2+z^2=a^2\) do not change at all if \(x\) is replaced by \(-x\text{.}\) Consequently both cylinders, and hence our solid, is symmetric about the \(yz\)-plane. In particular the volume of the part of the solid in the octant \(x\le 0\text{,}\) \(y\ge 0\text{,}\) \(z\ge 0\) is the same as the volume in the first octant \(x\ge 0\text{,}\) \(y\ge 0\text{,}\) \(z\ge 0\text{.}\) Similarly, the equations do not change at all if \(y\) is replaced by \(-y\) or if \(z\) is replaced by \(-z\text{.}\) Our solid is also symmetric about both the \(xz\)-plane and the \(xy\)-plane. Hence the volume of the part of our solid in each of the eight octants is the same.</li>
<li>So we will compute the volume of the part of the solid in the first octant, i.e. with \(x\ge 0\text{,}\) \(y\ge 0\text{,}\) \(z\ge 0\text{.}\) The total volume of the solid is eight times that.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">The part of the solid in the first octant is sketched in the figure on the left below. A point \((x,y,z)\) lies in the first cylinder if and only if \(x^2+y^2\le a^2\text{.}\)</p>
