It is not at all clear that rewriting <em class="emphasis">I have a ton of work to do</em> as <em class="emphasis">I have a tonne of work to do</em> achieves very much except to give the impression that the author is wasting time adding two letters when they are expressing the sheer quantity of tasks that require their attention. Speaking of which, the authors should end this footnote, and get on with the next example.</div></body>
