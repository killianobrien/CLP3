<p>To get the height of the parallelepiped, we drop a perpendicular from the head of \(\va\) to the line that passes through the tail of \(\va\) and is perpendicular to the base of the parallelepiped. In other words, from the head of \(\va\) to the line that contains both the head and the tail of \(\vb\times\vc\text{.}\) So the height of the parallelepiped is \(|\va|\,|\cos\varphi|\text{.}\)  (The absolute values have been included because if the angle between \(\vb\times\vc\) and \(\va\) happens to be greater than \(90^\circ\text{,}\) the \(\cos\varphi\) produced by taking the dot product of \(\va\) and  \((\vb\times\vc\)) will be negative.)</p>
