The result of the inside integral is a function of \(x\) only.  Call it \(F(x)\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Then evaluate the outside integral \(\int_a^b F(x)\,\dee{x}\text{,}\) whose integrand is the answer to the inside integral. Again, this integral is evaluated using standard single variable integration techniques.</li>

<p>To evaluate the integral \(\displaystyle\int_a^b \dee{x} \int_{B(x)}^{T(x)} \dee{y}\, f\big(x,y\big)\text{,}\)</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>first evaluate the inside integral \(\int_{B(x)}^{T(x)} \dee{y}\, f\big(x,y\big)\) using the limits of integration that are directly beside the \(\dee{y}\text{.}\) Indeed the \(\dee{y}\) is written directly beside \(\int_{B(x)}^{T(x)}\) to make it clear that the limits of integration \(B(x)\) and \(T(x)\) are for the \(y\)-integral. In the past you probably wrote this integral as \(\int_{B(x)}^{T(x)} f\big(x,y\big)\ \dee{y}\text{.}\) The result of the inside integral is again a function of \(x\) only.  Call it \(F(x)\text{.}\)</li>
