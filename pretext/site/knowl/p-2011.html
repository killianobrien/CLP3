<p>A mosquito is at the location \((3, 2, 1)\) in \(\bbbr^3\text{.}\) She knows that the temperature \(T\) near there is given by \(T = 2x^2 + y^2 - z^2\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>She wishes to stay at the same temperature, but must fly in some initial direction. Find a direction in which the initial rate of change of the temperature is \(0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>If you and another student both get correct answers in part (a), must the directions you give be the same? Why or why not?</li>
<li>What initial direction or directions would suit the mosquito if she wanted to cool down as fast as possible?</li>
</ol>
