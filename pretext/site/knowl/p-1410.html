<p>To help remember the formulae of Theorem <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_chainRule.html" title="Theorem 2.4.1: The Chain Rule">2.4.1</a>, it is sometimes also useful to pretend that our variables are physical quantities with \(f,F\) having units of grams, \(x,y\) having units of meters and \(s,t\) having units of seconds. Note that</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>the left hand side, \(\pdiff{F}{s}\text{,}\) has units grams per second.</li>
<li>Each term on the right hand side contains the partial derivative of \(f\) with respect to a different independent variable. That independent variable appears once in the denominator and once in the numerator, so that its units (in this case meters) cancel out. Thus both of the terms \(\pdiff{f}{x }\pdiff{x }{s}\) and \(\pdiff{f}{y }\pdiff{y }{s}\) on the right hand side also have the units grams per second.</li>
<li>Hence both sides of the equation have the same units.</li>
