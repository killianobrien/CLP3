<p>Here is why it is OK, in this case, to just sketch the first octant. Replacing \(x\) by \(-x\) in the equation \(4x^2+y^2-z^2=1\) does not change the equation. That means that a point \((x,y,z)\) is on the surface if and only if the point \((-x,y,z)\) is on the surface. So the surface is invariant under reflection in the \(yz\)-plane. Similarly, the equation \(4x^2+y^2-z^2=1\) does not change when \(y\) is replaced by \(-y\) or \(z\) is replaced by \(-z\text{.}\) Our surface is also invariant reflection in the \(xz\)- and \(xy\)-planes. Once we have the part in the first octant, the remaining octants can be gotten simply by reflecting about the coordinate planes.</p>
