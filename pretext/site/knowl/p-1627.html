<p>We'll find its highest and lowest points by exploiting the fact that the tangent plane to \(G=2\) is horizontal at the highest and lowest points. Equivalently, the normal vector to \(G=2\) is vertical at the highest and lowest points. To see that this is the case, look at the figure below. If the tangent plane at \((x_0,y_0,z_0)\) is not horizontal, then the tangent plane contains points near \((x_0,y_0,z_0)\) with \(z\) bigger than \(z_0\) and points near \((x_0,y_0,z_0)\) with \(z\) smaller than \(z_0\text{.}\) Near \((x_0,y_0,z_0)\text{,}\) the tangent plane is a good approximation to the surface. So the surface also contains<a class="fn-knowl" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-56-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.5.10"><sup> 10 </sup></a> such points.</p>
