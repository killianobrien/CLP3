<p>To this point we have always solved such constrained optimization problems either by</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>solving \(g(x,y)=0\) for \(y\) as a function of \(x\) (or for \(x\) as a function of \(y\)) or by</li>
<li>parametrizing the curve \(g(x,y)=0\text{.}\) This means writing all points of the curve in the form \(\big(x(t), y(t)\big)\) for some functions \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\text{.}\) For example we used \(x(t)=\cos t\text{,}\) \(y(t)=\sin t\) as a parametrization of the circle \(x^2+y^2=1\) in Example <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eg_MXMNabsA.html" title="Example 2.9.21">2.9.21</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">However quite often the function \(g(x,y)\) is so complicated that one cannot explicitly solve \(g(x,y)=0\) for \(y\) as a function  of \(x\) or for \(x\) as a function of \(y\) and one also cannot explicitly parametrize \(g(x,y)=0\text{.}\) Or sometimes you can, for example, solve \(g(x,y)=0\) for \(y\) as a function of \(x\text{,}\) but the resulting solution is so complicated that it is really hard, or even virtually impossible, to work with. Direct attacks become even harder in higher dimensions when, for example, we wish to optimize a function \(f(x,y,z)\) subject to a constraint \(g(x,y,z)=0\text{.}\)</p>
