<body><div class="fn">“Handwaving” is sometimes used as a pejorative to refer to an argument that lacks substance. Here we are just using it to indicate that we have left out a bunch of technical details. In mathematics, “nose-following” is sometimes used as the polar opposite of handwaving. It refers to a very narrow, mechanical, line of reasoning.</div></body>
