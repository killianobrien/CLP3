<p>(c) Note that in part (a) we showed that as \((x,y)\) approaches \((0,0)\) along any straight line, \(f(x,y)\) approaches the limit zero. In part (b) we have just shown that as \((x,y)\) approaches \((0,0)\) along the parabola \(y=x^2\text{,}\) \(f(x,y)\) approaches the limit \(\half\text{,}\) <em class="emphasis">not</em> zero. So \(f(x,y)\) takes values very close to \(0\text{,}\) for some \((x,y)\)'s that are  really near \((0,0)\) and also takes values very close to \(\frac{1}{2}\text{,}\) for other \((x,y)\)'s that are  really near \((0,0)\text{.}\) There is no single number, \(L\text{,}\) with the property that \(f(x,y)\) is really close to \(L\) for all \((x,y)\) that are really close to \((0,0)\text{.}\) So the limit does not exist.</p>
