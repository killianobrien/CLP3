<p>It is often easier to develop an understanding of the behaviour of a function \(f(x,y)\) by looking at a sketch of its level curves, than it is by looking at a sketch of its graph. On the other hand, you can also use a sketch of the level curves of \(f(x,y)\) as the first step in building a sketch of the graph \(z=f(x,y)\text{.}\) The next step would be to redraw, for each \(C\text{,}\) the level curve \(f(x,y)=C\text{,}\) in the plane \(z=C\text{,}\) as we did in Example <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eg_hyperboloid.html" title="Example 1.7.1: \(4x^2+y^2-z^2=1\)">1.7.1</a>.</p>
