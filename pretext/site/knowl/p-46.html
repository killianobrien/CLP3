<p>For each fixed \(y_0\text{,}\) \(z=x,\ y=y_0\) is a straight line that lies in the plane, \(y=y_0\) (which is parallel to the plane containing the \(x\) and \(z\) axes and is a distance \(y_0\) from it). This line passes through \(x=z=0\) and makes an angle \(45^\circ\) with the \(xy\)-plane. Such a line (with \(y_0=0\)) is sketched in the figure below. The set \(z=x\) is the union of all the lines \(z=x,\ y=y_0\) with all values of \(y_0\text{.}\) As \(y_0\) varies  \(z=x,\ y=y_0\) sweeps out the plane which contains the \(y\)-axis and which  makes an angle \(45^\circ\) with the \(xy\)-plane. Here is a sketch of the part of the plane that is in the first octant.</p>
