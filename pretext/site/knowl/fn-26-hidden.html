<body><div class="fn">The earliest known written approximations of \(\pi\text{,}\) in Egypt and Babylon, date from 1900â€“1600BC. The first recorded algorithm for rigorously evaluating \(\pi\) was developed by Archimedes around 250 BC. The first use of the symbol \(\pi\text{,}\) for the ratio between the circumference of a circle and its diameter, in print was in 1706 by William Jones.</div></body>
