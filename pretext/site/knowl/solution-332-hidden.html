<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p>The height \(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\) at \((x,y)\) is the distance from \((x,y)\) to \((0,0)\text{.}\) So the minimum height is zero at \((0,0,0)\text{.}\) The surface is a cone. The cone has a point at \((0,0,0)\) and the derivatives \(z_x\) and \(z_y\) do not exist there. The maximum height is achieved when \((x,y)\) is as far as possible from \((0,0)\text{.}\) The highest points are at \((\pm 1,\pm 1,\sqrt{2})\text{.}\) There \(z_x\) and \(z_y\) exist but are not zero. These points would not be the highest points if it were not for the restriction \(|x|,|y|\le 1\text{.}\)</p></div></body>
