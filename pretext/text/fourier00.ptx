<title>Fourier series</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    In this chapter we learn how to express certain periodic functions as series of sine and cosine functions. Such a series is called a Fourier series. This and other aspects of Fourier analysis find important applications in the field of sound processing (and signal processing in general).

          then there exist a set of coefficients
          <me>
            a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots , b_1, b_2 , \dots \in \mathbb{R},
          </me>
          such that at any point of <m>x</m> of continuity of <m>f</m> 
          we have
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{1}{2} a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \cos(nx) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \sin(nx),

          and at points of discontinuity, <m>x_d</m>, the series satisfies
          <me>
            \frac{1}{2} \left ( f(x_d^+) + f(x_d^-) \right ) =
\frac{1}{2} a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \cos(nx) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \sin(nx),
          </me>
          where
          <me>
          f(x_d^+) = \lim_{x \downarrow x_d} f(x), \quad
          f(x_d^-) = \lim_{x \uparrow x_d} f(x).

    </theorem>
    <p>
      The series of sines and cosines is referred to as the Fourier series for <m>f</m>. It agrees with <m>f</m> at all points of continuity of <m>f</m> and takes the average value of the left and right-handed limits of <m>f</m> at points of discontinuity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem of finding a Fourier series for a given function <m>f</m> is the problem of determining the values of the <em>Fourier coefficients</em> <m>a_0, a_n , b_n, \, \, (n \geq 1)</m>, of <m>f</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The existence of Fourier series, and the method for finding the coefficients rely on the fact that the family of functions
        <me>
        F= \left \{ 1, \cos(nx), \sin(nx) \, : \,  n \geq 1 \right \},
        </me>
        form an <em>orthogonal basis</em> for the infinite-dimensional vector space of functions satisfying the conditions in Fourier's theorem with respect to the inner-product
        <me>
          \langle \phi, \psi \rangle = \int_{-\pi}^\pi \phi(x) \psi(x) \, dx .
        </me>
        That is
        <me>
           \forall \phi, \psi \in F , \phi \neq \psi \Rightarrow \langle \phi, \psi \rangle = 0.
        </me>
      </p>
  <p>
    The various cases of the orthogonality of <m>F</m> can be proved by evaluating the integrals using standard trigonometric substitutions. 
    </p>
  <example>
    <p>
    Show that the functions <m>\phi(x)=\cos(mx)</m> and <m>\psi(x)=\sin(nx)</m> are orthogonal with respect to <m>\langle \, \,  , \,  \rangle</m>.
    </p>
  </example>
  <example>
    <p>
      Evaluate <m>\langle \phi, \psi \rangle</m> when <m>\phi(x) = \psi(x) =
\sin(nx)</m>.
    </p>
  </example>

    <title>Determining the Fourier coefficients</title>
    <p>
      The Fourier coefficients for a given function <m>f</m> can be found by evaluating the integral formulae.
      <md>
        <mrow>a_0  \amp = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi f(x) \, dx,</mrow>
        <mrow>a_n \amp = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi f(x) \cos(nx) \, dx, \quad (n \geq 1)</mrow>
        <mrow>b_n \amp = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi f(x) \sin(nx) \, dx \quad (n \geq 1).</mrow>
      </md>
      These can be justified by starting with the Fourier series for <m>f</m> and applying the orthogonality property of the inner product.
