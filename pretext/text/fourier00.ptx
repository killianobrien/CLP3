<title>Fourier series</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    In this chapter we learn how to express certain periodic functions as series of sine and cosine functions. Such a series is called a Fourier series. This and other aspects of Fourier analysis find important applications in the field of sound processing (and signal processing in general).

      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}</m> is a periodic function of period <m>2 \pi</m> and in the interval <m>(-\pi, \pi)</m> has
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                at most a finite number of discontinuities ,

            </li>

              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          then there exist a set of coefficients
          <me>
            a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots , b_1, b_2 , \dots \in \mathbb{R},
          </me>
          such that at any point of <m>x</m> of continuity of <m>f</m> 
          we have
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{1}{2} a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \cos(nx) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \sin(nx),
          </me>
          and at points of discontinuity, <m>x_d</m>, the series satisfies
          <me>
            \frac{1}{2} \left ( f(x_d^+) + f(x_d^-) \right ) =
\frac{1}{2} a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \cos(nx) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \sin(nx),
          </me>
          where
          <me>
          f(x_d^+) = \lim_{x \downarrow x_d} f(x), \quad
          f(x_d^-) = \lim_{x \uparrow x_d} f(x).            
          </me>

      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The series of sines and cosines is referred to as the Fourier series for <m>f</m>. It agrees with <m>f</m> at all points of continuity of <m>f</m> and takes the average value of the left and right-handed limits of <m>f</m> at points of discontinuity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem of finding a Fourier series for a given function <m>f</m> is the problem of determining the values of the <em>Fourier coefficients</em> <m>a_0, a_n , b_n, \, \, (n \geq 1)</m>, of <m>f</m>.
